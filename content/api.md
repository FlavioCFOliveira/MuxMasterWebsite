# Public API

The public API of MuxMaster v1.3.0: every exported type, function, method, constant, and field of the root package `github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/MuxMaster` and of the `middleware` package, with the signatures and doc comments the compiler sees. The root package implements an `http.Handler`-compatible HTTP router built on a radix tree, with typed parameter accessors, response helpers, route introspection, and support for the HTTP QUERY method (RFC 10008) through `MethodQuery`, `Mux.QUERY`, `Mux.QUERYE`, `Mux.QUERYFast`, `Group.QUERY`, and `Group.QUERYE`. The `middleware` package exports 21 middleware constructors.

For the SemVer tier policy that governs which symbols below are stable, see the [Compatibility](/compatibility) page. For a guide to the QUERY method, see [HTTP QUERY method (RFC 10008)](/docs/http-query-method).

> **Performance figures in the package documentation.** The "Performance" section of the package comment below quotes upstream measurements: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, Go 1.27.0, 2026-09-26, `-count=3`, from [`docs/performance.md`](https://github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/MuxMaster/blob/v1.3.0/docs/performance.md) at the v1.3.0 tag. This website's own benchmark campaign (go1.27.1, `-count=10`, with significance tests) is published on the [Benchmarks](/benchmarks) page.

## github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/MuxMaster

```go
package muxmaster // import "github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/MuxMaster"

Package muxmaster is a high-performance HTTP router for Go that is 100%
compatible with the standard net/http package, requires zero external
dependencies, and is built on a radix tree (compressed prefix trie) that
delivers O(k) route lookup — where k is the length of the URL path, not the
number of registered routes.

### Quick start

    mux := muxmaster.New()
    mux.GET("/users/:id", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        id := muxmaster.PathParam(r, "id")
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "user=%s", id)
    })
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux)

### Route patterns

Static segments match literally; dynamic segments use one of three forms:

  - Named parameter: /users/:id — single non-slash segment
  - Regex parameter: /items/{id:[0-9]+} — Go regexp restricted match
  - Catch-all: /static/*filepath — matches the rest of the path

Catch-all values are the unsanitised remainder of the request path (decoded
r.URL.Path, or r.URL.RawPath when Mux.UseRawPath is set), so they may contain
dot-dot segments. Handlers that map a catch-all value to files must use
http.FileServer or ServeFiles, which clean the path, or clean and confine the
value themselves to prevent directory traversal.

### Middleware

Three orthogonal middleware scopes are supported:

  - Mux.Use: stdlib http.Handler middleware applied at registration time;
    wraps Mux.Handle routes only. Registering a HandleFast route after Use
    panics.
  - Mux.UseFast: FastMiddleware that wraps HandleFast routes only.
  - Mux.Pre: pre-dispatch middleware that wraps BOTH Handle and HandleFast
    routes; ideal for cross-cutting policy (auth, logging, request_id).

See the SECURITY.md "Pre vs Use security boundary" section for the full matrix.

Use and UseFast middleware must be registered before the routes they should
wrap. Registering routes after the server has started serving is not supported.

### Performance

Root-package benchmarks on AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX (Go 1.27.0, 2026-09-26; see
docs/performance.md for the method and the full tables):

  - Static route: 28.6 ns / 0 allocs
  - 1-param Handle (default): 118.5 ns / 1 alloc / 384 B
  - 1-param HandleFast (default): 46.2 ns / 1 alloc / 32 B
  - 1-param Handle + Mux.PoolRequestBundle = true: 48.5 ns / 0 allocs

Mux.PoolFastParams = true also removes the 1-param HandleFast allocation;
the 2026-09-26 run has no benchmark for it.

HandleFast routes bypass the requestCtx allocation by passing Params directly as
the third handler argument; they trade off stdlib middleware compatibility for
raw throughput.

Mux.PoolRequestBundle and Mux.PoolFastParams are opt-in switches that recycle
the per-request objects via sync.Pool, dropping the entire hot path to zero
allocations. They require a stricter handler lifetime contract: handlers must
not retain *http.Request (or the Params slice for FastHandler) past return.
See docs/max-performance.md for the audit checklist and worked recipes.

### Compatibility

See COMPATIBILITY.md for the SemVer scheme, tier classification of the public
API surface, deprecation policy, and Go version policy.

CONSTANTS

const MethodQuery = "QUERY"
    MethodQuery is the HTTP QUERY method, standardized by RFC 10008
    (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc10008.html, June 2026). Per RFC 10008
    section 2, QUERY is safe and idempotent like GET and HEAD, but — like POST —
    it carries request content (a "query") in its body.

    As of Go 1.27, the standard library's net/http package does not define
    a MethodQuery constant (tracked by the Go project as golang/go#80058).
    MuxMaster defines this constant so callers do not need to write the literal
    string "QUERY". If a future Go release adds http.MethodQuery, its value is
    guaranteed to be "QUERY" — RFC 10008 defines the method token and Go does
    not redefine HTTP method tokens — so MuxMaster's constant remains equal
    to it and no code using MethodQuery needs to change. MuxMaster does not
    deprecate or remove MethodQuery when that happens.

    The router performs no validation of a QUERY request's Content-Type or body;
    that responsibility belongs to the registered handler (see the QUERY method
    on *Mux).


FUNCTIONS

func JSON(w http.ResponseWriter, code int, v any) error
    JSON marshals v to JSON and writes it with the given status code. Returns
    any marshalling or write error.

func NoContent(w http.ResponseWriter)
    NoContent writes a 204 No Content response.

func PathParam(r *http.Request, name string) string
    PathParam returns the value of the named path parameter from the request.

    SECURITY: Path parameters may contain any byte, including CR/LF and NUL.
    When UseRawPath=false (the default), net/http decodes percent-encoded
    sequences before routing. A request like /users/%0D%0ASet-Cookie:%20hacked
    becomes /users/\r\nSet-Cookie: hacked in the matched parameter. Handlers
    must not echo parameters directly into headers or logs without escaping (use
    url.PathEscape for header injection mitigation, html.EscapeString for logs).

func Redirect(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, code int, url string)
    Redirect sends an HTTP redirect to url with the given status code.

func RoutePattern(r *http.Request) string
    RoutePattern returns the registered route pattern that matched the request,
    or "" if none has been stored in the context. Only routes with at least one
    parameter (named, regex or catch-all) store their pattern, so RoutePattern
    returns "" for a static route, for the NotFound, MethodNotAllowed, automatic
    OPTIONS and redirect handlers, and inside Pre middleware, which runs before
    routing. A static route of a *Mux attached with Mount sees the mount's own
    pattern, prefix + "/*mux_mount", because the context stores the nearest
    parameterised match.

func Text(w http.ResponseWriter, code int, s string) error
    Text writes s as plain text with the given status code.

func XML(w http.ResponseWriter, code int, v any) error
    XML marshals v to XML and writes it with the given status code. Returns any
    marshalling or write error.


TYPES

type FastHandler func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, Params)
    FastHandler is a high-performance request handler that receives path
    parameters as a direct argument, bypassing the context allocation overhead
    of http.Handler routes.

    LIFETIME — default mode (Mux.PoolFastParams == false): the dispatcher
    allocates a fresh Params slice per request. The slice (and its backing
    array) remain valid even after the handler returns — goroutines spawned from
    the handler may safely capture and use ps.

    LIFETIME — pooled mode (Mux.PoolFastParams == true, Opt O9): the Params
    slice is drawn from a sync.Pool tier (1/2/3 params) and is RETURNED to
    the pool the instant the handler returns. Handlers in pooled mode MUST NOT
    retain ps (or any backing element) past return. Goroutines that capture ps
    would observe zeroed values at best, or values from an unrelated request at
    worst (indistinguishable from a use-after-free).

    If a handler in pooled mode must retain params past return, copy them first:

        func myHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, ps muxmaster.Params) {
            ps2 := make(muxmaster.Params, len(ps))
            copy(ps2, ps)
            go func() { use(ps2) }() // safe — ps2 owns the data
        }

    FastHandler routes do not support stdlib middleware (func(http.Handler)
    http.Handler). Use FastMiddleware instead, or register the route with Handle
    for full stdlib compatibility.

type FastMiddleware func(FastHandler) FastHandler
    FastMiddleware wraps a FastHandler, following the same composition model as
    stdlib middleware but for FastHandler routes only.

type Group struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Group is a set of routes sharing a common path prefix and middleware stack.
    Create one via Mux.Group; nest further via Group.Group.

func (g *Group) ANY(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    ANY registers h on path for every supported method: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT,
    PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE and QUERY.

func (g *Group) CONNECT(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    CONNECT registers a HandlerFunc for CONNECT requests on path.

func (g *Group) DELETE(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    DELETE registers a HandlerFunc for DELETE requests on path.

func (g *Group) DELETEE(path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    DELETEE registers a HandlerFuncE for DELETE requests on path. Errors are
    passed to g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (g *Group) GET(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    GET registers a HandlerFunc for GET requests on path.

func (g *Group) GETE(path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    GETE registers a HandlerFuncE for GET requests on path. Errors are passed to
    g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (g *Group) Group(prefix string) *Group
    Group returns a sub-group sharing the same mux with an extended prefix.
    The full prefix is g.prefix joined with prefix (see specification/groups.md
    section 11). The sub-group starts with a copy of the parent group's
    middleware stacks; middleware added to either group afterwards does not
    affect the other.

func (g *Group) HEAD(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    HEAD registers a HandlerFunc for HEAD requests on path.

func (g *Group) HEADE(path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    HEADE registers a HandlerFuncE for HEAD requests on path. Errors are passed
    to g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (g *Group) Handle(method, path string, handler http.Handler)
    Handle registers handler under this group with the given method and path.
    The full path is g.prefix joined with path (see specification/groups.md
    section 11). Mux-level middleware wraps the group middleware.

func (g *Group) HandleE(method, path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    HandleE registers a HandlerFuncE under this group. Errors are passed to
    g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned. The error handler
    is read from the frozen muxConfig at request time — see Mux.HandleE for the
    rationale.

func (g *Group) HandleFast(method, path string, h FastHandler)
    HandleFast registers a FastHandler under this group with the given
    method and path. The full path is g.prefix joined with path (see
    specification/groups.md section 11). Mux-level FastMiddleware wraps the
    group FastMiddleware.

    SECURITY: panics if the group has stdlib middleware registered via Use().
    Stdlib middleware is incompatible with the FastHandler dispatch path —
    silently mixing them would let HandleFast routes bypass authentication,
    authorisation, logging or any other Use()-registered middleware. Operators
    must use UseFast() for FastHandler routes, or Handle() for routes that
    should run through the stdlib middleware chain.

func (g *Group) HandleFunc(method, path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    HandleFunc registers a HandlerFunc under this group.

func (g *Group) Match(methods []string, path string, handler http.Handler)
    Match registers handler for each of the listed methods on path.

func (g *Group) Mount(prefix string, h http.Handler)
    Mount attaches h at g.prefix joined with prefix (see specification/groups.md
    section 11), stripping the full prefix before forwarding. See Mux.Mount
    for the registered pattern and panics. The group's stdlib middleware
    (registered via Use) wraps the mounted handler so authentication, logging,
    etc. apply to every request reaching h, and a Group with BasicAuth/JWTAuth
    protects the mounted handler.

func (g *Group) OPTIONS(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    OPTIONS registers a HandlerFunc for OPTIONS requests on path.

func (g *Group) OPTIONSE(path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    OPTIONSE registers a HandlerFuncE for OPTIONS requests on path. Errors are
    passed to g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (g *Group) PATCH(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    PATCH registers a HandlerFunc for PATCH requests on path.

func (g *Group) PATCHE(path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    PATCHE registers a HandlerFuncE for PATCH requests on path. Errors are
    passed to g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (g *Group) POST(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    POST registers a HandlerFunc for POST requests on path.

func (g *Group) POSTE(path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    POSTE registers a HandlerFuncE for POST requests on path. Errors are passed
    to g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (g *Group) PUT(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    PUT registers a HandlerFunc for PUT requests on path.

func (g *Group) PUTE(path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    PUTE registers a HandlerFuncE for PUT requests on path. Errors are passed to
    g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (g *Group) QUERY(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    QUERY registers a HandlerFunc for QUERY requests on path. QUERY is a
    standard HTTP method (RFC 10008); see MethodQuery. *Group has no dedicated
    QUERYFast: register a fast QUERY route via g.HandleFast(MethodQuery, path,
    h).

func (g *Group) QUERYE(path string, h HandlerFuncE)
    QUERYE registers a HandlerFuncE for QUERY requests on path. Errors are
    passed to g.mux.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned. QUERY is a
    standard HTTP method (RFC 10008); see MethodQuery.

func (g *Group) Route(prefix string, fn func(*Group))
    Route creates a sub-group at prefix and calls fn with it.

func (g *Group) ServeFiles(prefix string, root http.FileSystem)
    ServeFiles serves static files from root under g.prefix joined with prefix
    (see specification/groups.md section 11). prefix must end with "/*name"
    (relative to the group prefix).

    http.FileServer receives a shallow copy of the request (see the Terminology
    section in specification/README.md): a new *http.Request with a new URL,
    but sharing the original's header map and context.

    SECURITY: like Mux.ServeFiles, it panics when the owning Mux
    has both UseRawPath and UnescapePathValues set at the time of the call.
    See Mux.ServeFiles for the rationale.

func (g *Group) TRACE(path string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    TRACE registers a HandlerFunc for TRACE requests on path.

func (g *Group) Use(middleware ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler)
    Use appends middleware to this group's chain. Must be called before
    registering routes on the group.

func (g *Group) UseFast(mw ...FastMiddleware)
    UseFast appends FastMiddleware to this group's fast-route chain. Must be
    called before registering HandleFast routes on the group.

func (g *Group) With(mw ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler) *Group
    With returns a copy of this group with additional middleware appended.

type HTTPError interface {
	error
	StatusCode() int
}
    HTTPError is an error that carries an HTTP status code.

func Error(code int, err error) HTTPError
    Error constructs an HTTPError wrapping err with the given HTTP status code.
    Panics if err is nil.

type HandlerFuncE func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) error
    HandlerFuncE is a handler that returns an error, allowing centralised error
    handling.

type Mux struct {

	// RedirectTrailingSlash redirects /foo/ → /foo (or /foo → /foo/) when a
	// handler exists at the alternate path.
	RedirectTrailingSlash bool

	// RedirectFixedPath redirects a request whose path has no route, but
	// whose path.Clean form does, to that cleaned path (for example //users
	// or /a/../users to /users). New leaves it false: a redirect to a
	// canonicalised path can bypass path-inspecting middleware.
	RedirectFixedPath bool

	// HandleMethodNotAllowed returns 405 with an Allow header when the path
	// exists but not for the requested method.
	HandleMethodNotAllowed bool

	// HandleOPTIONS replies to OPTIONS requests for a path that has no
	// explicit OPTIONS route with 204 No Content and an Allow header listing
	// the methods registered for that path.
	HandleOPTIONS bool

	// CaseInsensitive enables case-insensitive route matching for static segments.
	CaseInsensitive bool

	// UseRawPath uses r.URL.RawPath for matching when set and non-empty.
	UseRawPath bool

	// UnescapePathValues percent-decodes path parameter values before storing
	// them. Only takes effect when UseRawPath is also true: when UseRawPath is
	// false (the default) net/http already decodes the URL path during parsing
	// and a second decode would corrupt values containing literal '%XX' (a
	// double decode would turn %2520 into a space and bypass space-blocking
	// input validators). Set both UseRawPath and UnescapePathValues to retrieve
	// decoded values from the original raw path bytes.
	//
	// SECURITY: when UseRawPath=true AND UnescapePathValues=true,
	// `%2f` inside a single segment is matched as one path segment by the radix
	// tree (because `/` is preserved as separator only via literal slash) and
	// then DECODED in the captured param value. A request such as
	// `/files/..%2fetc%2fpasswd` binds `:filepath` to the literal string
	// `..\x2fetc\x2fpasswd` — i.e. the captured value contains a real slash.
	// Handlers that pass `ParamsFromContext(...).Get("filepath")` to
	// `os.Open`, `http.FileServer`, or any URL/file API WITHOUT calling
	// `path.Clean` (and rejecting values that contain `..`) allow directory
	// traversal. The CleanPath middleware does NOT normalise
	// post-decode values; it only canonicalises the request path before
	// dispatch. See SECURITY.md "UseRawPath traversal" and
	// examples/static-site/ for the safe pattern.
	UnescapePathValues bool

	// RedirectCode overrides the status code of the automatic trailing-slash
	// and fixed-path redirects. Zero (the default) means 301 Moved
	// Permanently for GET and HEAD and 307 Temporary Redirect for every
	// other method, including QUERY, so the method and body are preserved.
	RedirectCode int

	// NotFound is called when no route matches (default: http.NotFound).
	NotFound http.Handler

	// MethodNotAllowed is called on 405 (default: plain-text response).
	MethodNotAllowed http.Handler

	// GlobalOPTIONS is called for auto-handled OPTIONS requests instead of
	// the default 204 No Content response.
	GlobalOPTIONS http.Handler

	// ErrorHandler handles errors returned by HandlerFuncE handlers.
	// Default: 500 Internal Server Error.
	ErrorHandler func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, error)

	// PanicHandler recovers from panics in handlers and receives the
	// ResponseWriter, Request, and recovered value.
	//
	// SECURITY: PanicHandler implementations MUST
	// NOT themselves panic. MuxMaster's recover frame catches the FIRST
	// panic and dispatches into PanicHandler; if PanicHandler panics again
	// the secondary panic is NOT recovered by MuxMaster. It propagates up
	// to the per-connection recover in net/http (server.go), which logs
	// "http: panic serving ..." and closes the TCP connection. There is
	// no goroutine leak and no process crash, but the connection is
	// terminated mid-response, which can confuse clients and HTTP/2
	// stream multiplexing. See SECURITY.md "Layered panic recovery".
	PanicHandler func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, any)

	// PoolFastParams, when true, recycles the Params slice handed to

	//
	// Default is FALSE for backward compatibility with handlers that rely

	// TestFastHandlerGoroutineSafe). Operators who audit their FastHandler
	// implementations and confirm they do not retain ps may opt in for the
	// allocation/variance reduction.
	PoolFastParams bool

	// PoolRequestBundle, when true, recycles the per-request reqBundle (the
	// fused requestCtx + http.Request copy) handed to http.Handler routes
	// with path parameters via a tiered sync.Pool. It eliminates the
	// per-request bundle allocation (a 384, 416 or 480 B size class for 1, 2
	// or 3+ parameters) on every param-route request and is the

	// enforces a strict lifetime contract:
	//
	//   Handlers MUST NOT retain the *http.Request (the one passed to
	//   ServeHTTP) past their return. Goroutines that capture r and outlive
	//   the handler observe a recycled request bound to an unrelated route —
	//   effectively a use-after-free against the bundle storage.
	//
	// This contract is stricter than the default mode, in which a handler
	// may retain r after returning: with PoolRequestBundle the storage behind
	// r is reused as soon as MuxMaster's dispatch returns.
	//

}
    Mux is a high-performance HTTP request multiplexer.

    Configuration fields (RedirectTrailingSlash, CaseInsensitive, etc.) are
    read once and frozen on the first ServeHTTP call. Use Rebuild to reset the
    snapshot when changing flags after the server has started serving.

func New() *Mux
    New returns a Mux with production-safe defaults: RedirectTrailingSlash,
    HandleMethodNotAllowed and HandleOPTIONS are true; RedirectFixedPath,
    CaseInsensitive, UseRawPath, UnescapePathValues, PoolFastParams and
    PoolRequestBundle are false; RedirectCode is 0 and every handler field is
    nil, selecting the documented defaults.

func (m *Mux) ANY(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    ANY registers h on pattern for every supported method: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT,
    PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE and QUERY.

func (m *Mux) CONNECT(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    CONNECT registers a HandlerFunc for CONNECT requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) CONNECTFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    CONNECTFast registers a FastHandler for CONNECT requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) DELETE(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    DELETE registers a HandlerFunc for DELETE requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) DELETEE(pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    DELETEE registers a HandlerFuncE for DELETE requests on pattern. Errors are
    passed to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (m *Mux) DELETEFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    DELETEFast registers a FastHandler for DELETE requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) GET(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    GET registers a HandlerFunc for GET requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) GETE(pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    GETE registers a HandlerFuncE for GET requests on pattern. Errors are passed
    to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (m *Mux) GETFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    GETFast registers a FastHandler for GET requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) Group(prefix string) *Group
    Group returns a *Group whose routes share the given path prefix. The group
    starts with no middleware of its own; the Mux's Use middleware still wraps
    its routes.

func (m *Mux) HEAD(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    HEAD registers a HandlerFunc for HEAD requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) HEADE(pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    HEADE registers a HandlerFuncE for HEAD requests on pattern. Errors are
    passed to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (m *Mux) HEADFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    HEADFast registers a FastHandler for HEAD requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) Handle(method, pattern string, handler http.Handler)
    Handle registers handler for the given HTTP method and path pattern.

    Path parameters use the ':name' syntax (/users/:id). Regex params use
    '{name:expr}' (/users/{id:[0-9]+}). Catch-all parameters use '*name' and
    must end the path (/static/*filepath). Catch-all values are the unsanitised
    remainder of the request path (decoded r.URL.Path, or r.URL.RawPath when
    UseRawPath is set) and may contain dot-dot segments; handlers serving files
    must use http.FileServer or ServeFiles, or clean and confine the value
    themselves.

    Panics on an empty or unsupported method, a path that does not begin with
    '/', a nil handler, or a route conflict. The supported methods are GET,
    HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE and QUERY.

func (m *Mux) HandleE(method, pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    HandleE registers a HandlerFuncE for the given method and path. Errors
    are passed to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned. The
    error handler is read from the frozen muxConfig snapshot at request time,
    so a post-startup mutation of m.ErrorHandler does not race with dispatch.

func (m *Mux) HandleFast(method, pattern string, h FastHandler)
    HandleFast registers a FastHandler for the given HTTP method and path.

    FastHandler routes bypass the context allocation overhead of http.Handler
    routes. Params are passed as a direct argument — see FastHandler for
    lifetime guarantees.

    SECURITY: Registering a HandleFast route after calling Use() panics.
    Stdlib middleware attached via Use does not
    wrap fast routes. Use Pre() for middleware that must cover both route types,
    or UseFast() for FastMiddleware that wraps only fast routes. See SECURITY.md
    "Pre vs Use security boundary" for the full matrix.

    PanicHandler (if set) recovers panics on both Handle and HandleFast paths.

    Panics on an empty or unsupported method, a path that does not begin
    with '/', a nil handler, a route conflict, or when Use() middleware is
    registered.

func (m *Mux) HandleFunc(method, pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    HandleFunc registers a HandlerFunc for the given method and path.

func (m *Mux) Lookup(method, path string) (http.Handler, Params, bool)
    Lookup performs a route lookup without dispatching a request. Returns (nil,
    nil, false) if path is empty or does not begin with '/', if method is not a
    supported method, or if no route matches.

    A route registered with HandleFast (or a *Fast helper) also matches: Lookup
    then returns a nil http.Handler, the captured Params and true. There is no
    fast-route counterpart of Lookup; use WalkFast to enumerate fast routes.

    Lookup matches path exactly as registered: it applies no trailing-slash or
    fixed-path redirect and ignores CaseInsensitive. Unlike ServeHTTP, which
    never takes a lock, Lookup holds the registration read lock while it runs.

func (m *Mux) Match(methods []string, pattern string, handler http.Handler)
    Match registers handler for each of the listed methods on pattern.

func (m *Mux) Mount(prefix string, h http.Handler)
    Mount attaches h at prefix, stripping the prefix before forwarding the
    request. Trailing '/' characters are removed from prefix, and the mount
    is registered under the internal method "*" with the pattern prefix +
    "/*mux_mount", which is how Routes lists it. Explicit routes in the request
    method's own tree take precedence over the mount. Middleware registered with
    Use before Mount wraps h. Panics if h is nil, if prefix does not begin with
    '/' or is not valid UTF-8, or if its last element is an optional parameter.

    h receives a shallow copy of the request (see the Terminology section in
    specification/README.md): a new *http.Request with a new URL, but sharing
    the original's header map, Trailer, Form and context. h may read the
    original request's headers, but must not mutate them in place — such a
    mutation would be visible to the caller's original request and to any outer
    middleware that runs after Mount returns.

func (m *Mux) OPTIONS(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    OPTIONS registers a HandlerFunc for OPTIONS requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) OPTIONSE(pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    OPTIONSE registers a HandlerFuncE for OPTIONS requests on pattern. Errors
    are passed to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (m *Mux) OPTIONSFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    OPTIONSFast registers a FastHandler for OPTIONS requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) PATCH(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    PATCH registers a HandlerFunc for PATCH requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) PATCHE(pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    PATCHE registers a HandlerFuncE for PATCH requests on pattern. Errors are
    passed to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (m *Mux) PATCHFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    PATCHFast registers a FastHandler for PATCH requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) POST(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    POST registers a HandlerFunc for POST requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) POSTE(pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    POSTE registers a HandlerFuncE for POST requests on pattern. Errors are
    passed to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (m *Mux) POSTFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    POSTFast registers a FastHandler for POST requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) PUT(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    PUT registers a HandlerFunc for PUT requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) PUTE(pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    PUTE registers a HandlerFuncE for PUT requests on pattern. Errors are passed
    to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned.

func (m *Mux) PUTFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    PUTFast registers a FastHandler for PUT requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) Pre(mw ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler)
    Pre registers middleware that runs before dispatch (e.g. before routing).
    Calling Pre rebuilds the pre-dispatch handler chain.

    SECURITY: Pre wraps the entire ServeHTTP dispatch and
    covers BOTH Handle (stdlib) and HandleFast routes. This makes Pre the
    correct registration point for cross-cutting policies that must apply
    uniformly — auth gates, CleanPath, RealIP, RecovererWithLogger, request IDs.
    See SECURITY.md "Pre vs Use security boundary".

func (m *Mux) QUERY(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    QUERY registers a HandlerFunc for QUERY requests on pattern.

    QUERY is a standard HTTP method, standardized by RFC 10008. Per RFC 10008
    section 2, it is safe and idempotent but — unlike GET — carries request
    content in its body; see MethodQuery. The router performs no validation
    of the Content-Type header or body of a QUERY request: RFC 10008 section
    2.1 requires servers to fail the request (400, 415, or 422) when the
    Content-Type field is missing or inconsistent with the request content, and
    RFC 10008 section 3 defines the Accept-Query response header for advertising
    supported query formats — implementing both is the responsibility of the
    registered handler.

func (m *Mux) QUERYE(pattern string, h HandlerFuncE)
    QUERYE registers a HandlerFuncE for QUERY requests on pattern. Errors are
    passed to m.ErrorHandler if set, otherwise a 500 is returned. QUERY is a
    standard HTTP method (RFC 10008); see MethodQuery.

func (m *Mux) QUERYFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    QUERYFast registers a FastHandler for QUERY requests on pattern. QUERY is a
    standard HTTP method (RFC 10008); see MethodQuery.

func (m *Mux) Rebuild()
    Rebuild resets the frozen configuration snapshot and the lazy NotFound /
    MethodNotAllowed / OPTIONS / redirect handler caches so the next ServeHTTP
    call re-reads every configuration field and rebuilds the wrapped handlers.

    Safe to call concurrently with ServeHTTP: every reset is a single atomic
    operation, and the next config() / lazyNotFound() / lazyMethodNotAllowed()
    / lazyOPTIONS() / lazyRedirect() call re-initialises via CompareAndSwap
    or sync.Map re-population. Intended for tests and dynamic reconfiguration
    scenarios.

func (m *Mux) Route(prefix string, fn func(*Group))
    Route creates a sub-group at prefix and calls fn with it.

func (m *Mux) Routes() []RouteInfo
    Routes returns a slice of RouteInfo for every registered route, including
    both http.Handler and FastHandler routes.

func (m *Mux) ServeFiles(prefix string, root http.FileSystem)
    ServeFiles serves static files from root under the given prefix pattern.
    prefix must end with "/*name" (e.g. "/static/*filepath").

    http.FileServer receives a shallow copy of the request (see the Terminology
    section in specification/README.md): a new *http.Request with a new URL,
    but sharing the original's header map and context.

    SECURITY: http.FileServer applies path.Clean internally,
    so a request like /static/../etc/passwd cannot escape root. However,
    when the Mux is configured with UseRawPath=true AND UnescapePathValues=true
    the captured filepath param contains decoded slashes
    and http.FileServer's clean step happens AFTER the param has already
    been re-set as r2.URL.Path — the decoded slashes act as path separators
    inside FileServer's tree. Registration with that combination panics
    so the misconfiguration is caught at boot. Disable one of UseRawPath /
    UnescapePathValues, or write a custom handler that calls path.Clean on the
    captured value and rejects ".." segments before dispatch.

func (m *Mux) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
    ServeHTTP implements http.Handler, dispatching through pre-middleware if
    set.

    The fast path (no PanicHandler, no pre-middleware) avoids the defer frame
    overhead entirely by going straight to dispatch. Deferred paths are isolated
    in dispatchWithRecover to keep this function inlineable.

func (m *Mux) TRACE(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
    TRACE registers a HandlerFunc for TRACE requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) TRACEFast(pattern string, h FastHandler)
    TRACEFast registers a FastHandler for TRACE requests on pattern.

func (m *Mux) Use(middleware ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler)
    Use appends one or more middleware to the chain. Each middleware wraps
    all handlers registered after this call. The first middleware added is
    outermost.

    SECURITY: Use does NOT wrap HandleFast routes — registering
    a fast route after Use(authMiddleware) panics at HandleFast call time on
    BOTH the root Mux and Groups, so the bypass
    cannot occur silently regardless of where the operator places the route.
    To apply policy to both stdlib and fast routes, use Pre(...) (outermost,
    route-type agnostic) or UseFast(...) for FastMiddleware. See SECURITY.md
    "Pre vs Use security boundary".

func (m *Mux) UseFast(mw ...FastMiddleware)
    UseFast appends one or more FastMiddleware to the chain applied to all
    HandleFast routes registered after this call. The first middleware added is
    outermost. Has no effect on routes registered via Handle.

    SECURITY: UseFast is the FastHandler counterpart of Use;
    together with Pre (which covers BOTH route types) it forms the route-type
    matrix documented in SECURITY.md "Pre vs Use security boundary". An auth
    gate applied only via Use(...) does NOT cover HandleFast routes.

func (m *Mux) Walk(fn func(method, pattern string, handler http.Handler) error) error
    Walk calls fn for each registered http.Handler route. FastHandler routes are
    skipped — use WalkFast to visit them. Stops iteration and returns the error
    if fn returns non-nil.

func (m *Mux) WalkFast(fn func(method, pattern string, handler FastHandler) error) error
    WalkFast calls fn for each registered FastHandler route. http.Handler routes
    are skipped — use Walk to visit them. Stops iteration and returns the error
    if fn returns non-nil.

func (m *Mux) With(mw ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler) *Group
    With returns a Group with the given middleware applied and an empty prefix.

type Param struct {
	Key   string
	Value string
}
    Param is a single URL path parameter (key + value).

type Params []Param
    Params is an ordered list of path parameters extracted from a URL.

func ParamsFromContext(ctx context.Context) Params
    ParamsFromContext returns the path parameters stored in ctx, or nil when
    ctx carries none (for example on a static route). ctx must not be nil;
    a request whose internal context is nil is dispatched by ServeHTTP with
    context.Background() as the parent, so r.Context() is always safe to pass.

func (ps Params) Bool(name string) (bool, error)
    Bool returns the named parameter parsed as bool.

func (ps Params) Float64(name string) (float64, error)
    Float64 returns the named parameter parsed as float64.

func (ps Params) Get(name string) string
    Get returns the value for the named parameter, or "" if not present.

func (ps Params) Int(name string) (int, error)
    Int returns the named parameter parsed as int (base 10). Returns a non-nil
    error if the key is absent, or the strconv error on parse failure.

func (ps Params) Int64(name string) (int64, error)
    Int64 returns the named parameter parsed as int64 (base 10).

func (ps Params) Lookup(name string) (value string, ok bool)
    Lookup returns the value and a presence flag for the named parameter.

func (ps Params) Map() map[string]string
    Map returns a copy of the parameters as a string map.

func (ps Params) Uint64(name string) (uint64, error)
    Uint64 returns the named parameter parsed as uint64 (base 10).

type RouteInfo struct {
	Method  string
	Pattern string
	Handler string
}
    RouteInfo describes a single registered route.

```

## github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/MuxMaster/middleware

```go
package middleware // import "github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/MuxMaster/middleware"

Package middleware provides common HTTP middleware handlers for use with
MuxMaster or any net/http-compatible router.

Each middleware is a function that takes an http.Handler and returns an
http.Handler, following the standard Go middleware pattern:

    func(next http.Handler) http.Handler

Usage with MuxMaster:

    import "github.com/FlavioCFOliveira/MuxMaster/middleware"

    mux := muxmaster.New()
    mux.Use(middleware.Logger(os.Stdout))
    mux.Use(middleware.RecovererWithLogger(slog.Default()))
    mux.Use(middleware.CORS(middleware.CORSOptions{
        AllowedOrigins: []string{"https://example.com"},
    }))

CONSTANTS

const DefaultThrottlePerIPMaxTableSize = 100_000
    DefaultThrottlePerIPMaxTableSize is the default upper bound on the number of
    distinct keys ThrottlePerIP will track concurrently. When the table is full,
    requests for NEW keys are rejected with 503 to bound memory under IP-churn
    attacks. Existing keys keep working.


FUNCTIONS

func APIKey(opts APIKeyOptions) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    APIKey authenticates requests by matching an extracted key against a
    pre-hashed set of valid keys. All keys are SHA-256 hashed at construction
    time; per-request cost is one SHA-256 hash plus a [32]byte map lookup — no
    iteration, no string comparison.

    On success, the identity string associated with the key is injected into the
    request context and retrievable via GetAPIKeyIdentity. Panics if opts.Keys
    is nil or empty.

func BasicAuth(realm string, creds map[string]string) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    BasicAuth enforces HTTP Basic Authentication using constant-time credential
    comparison. Usernames and passwords are SHA-256 hashed at construction time
    and stored as an unordered slice of {userHash, passHash} entries — not a
    map — so that authenticating a request never performs a data-dependent map
    lookup. Every request scans the ENTIRE entry slice unconditionally with
    subtle.ConstantTimeCompare / subtle.ConstantTimeCopy: there is no early
    exit and no branch whose outcome depends on whether the supplied username
    matches a registered one. A Go `map[string]V` lookup
    (`runtime.mapaccess2_faststr`) would take time that depends on hash-bucket
    occupancy and key comparison, and so would reveal whether a username
    exists; the constant-time scan does not. Cost scales linearly with the
    number of registered users (O(n) per request, always — matched or not); see
    BenchmarkBasicAuth for the per-user overhead. Both the supplied and the
    stored password are hashed before the comparison, so its time does not
    depend on the supplied password's length. Panics if creds is nil.

func CORS(opts CORSOptions) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    CORS handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Panics on invalid configuration.

    SECURITY: AllowedOrigins must be set explicitly. Passing nil or an
    empty slice is a misconfiguration trap: the middleware
    would silently let cross-origin requests through with no ACAO header,
    hiding the issue from the operator. We panic at construction time so the
    misconfiguration is caught at boot.

    ORDERING: CORS sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (and
    related Access-Control-* headers) when its frame runs. If another middleware
    that calls `Header().Set(...)` runs AFTER CORS in the request flow
    (innermost in the Use() chain), the late Set will OVERWRITE the CORS-managed
    values, silently bypassing the configured whitelist. To keep CORS
    authoritative, register CORS as the INNERMOST middleware that touches these
    headers (i.e. last in the Use() chain that handles them) or avoid calling
    SetHeader on CORS-managed names. See SetHeader for the composition rule.

    VARY (spec section 16): unlike the Access-Control-* headers
    above, `Vary: Origin` is added with Header.Add semantics — as an additional
    value alongside whatever Vary already carries, never overwriting it — so
    its correctness does not depend on Use()-chain order relative to other
    Vary-setting middleware (e.g. Compress). It is added to every response CORS
    produces or forwards, unconditionally.

func CleanPath() func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    CleanPath normalises r.URL.Path via path.Clean before routing. When
    r.URL.RawPath is set, it is also cleaned; if the cleaned RawPath differs
    from what path.Clean produces for the percent-decoded Path, RawPath is
    zeroed to prevent encoded path-traversal bypass.

    ORDERING: When composing CleanPath with path-inspecting Pre-gates
    (authorization checks that reject certain prefixes), CleanPath MUST
    be registered first. A gate registered before CleanPath sees the raw,
    unnormalised path and can be bypassed by /admin/../public, //admin,
    or %2e%2e-encoded variants. CleanPath must run first to normalise before the
    gate inspects the path.

    When the path changes, next receives a shallow copy of the request (see
    the Terminology section in the MuxMaster specification/README.md): a new
    *http.Request with a new URL, but sharing the original's header map and
    context. The original request passed to CleanPath is never mutated.

func Compress(level int) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    Compress compresses responses with gzip when the client accepts it.
    Responses smaller than 1024 bytes are passed through uncompressed. Uses
    streaming compression — memory usage is bounded regardless of response size.
    Panics on invalid compression level.

    OPERATIONAL: the compress middleware buffers up to 8 KiB
    per stalled connection while sniffing whether the response is large enough
    to compress. Operators MUST configure http.Server.ReadHeaderTimeout and
    http.Server.WriteTimeout (and a connection cap via a Listener limit) to
    bound the total memory held by N stalled connections; the middleware itself
    does not enforce a per-connection timeout.

    SECURITY (BREACH): do NOT echo user-controlled input
    alongside a secret (OAuth2 scope, CSRF token, session ID, JWT) inside
    a gzip-compressed response body. Compression amplifies tiny size
    differences that depend on whether the user's input matches a prefix
    of the secret (the BREACH attack), letting a client recover the secret
    character by character.

    Mitigations, in order of preference:

     1. Do not compress endpoints that echo user input near secrets — wrap them
        with a different middleware chain that excludes Compress.
     2. Move secrets out of the response body (set them in headers, cookies,
        or separate API endpoints not reachable via attacker-controlled input).
     3. Add variable-length random padding (>= 256 bytes, length
        randomised per request) to the response body. Fixed-length padding is
        not sufficient.

    MuxMaster cannot apply these mitigations on the operator's behalf because
    they require knowledge of which fields are secret vs user-controlled.
    See SECURITY.md "BREACH mitigation" for the full pattern.

func GetAPIKeyIdentity(ctx context.Context) (string, bool)
    GetAPIKeyIdentity returns the identity string associated with the validated
    API key, as injected by the APIKey middleware.

func GetRequestID(ctx context.Context) string
    GetRequestID returns the request ID stored in ctx, or "" if absent.

func JWTAuth(opts JWTOptions) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    JWTAuth validates JWT Bearer tokens from the Authorization header. Signature
    is always verified before claims are parsed to prevent payload manipulation.
    On success, claims are injected into the request context via GetJWTClaims.

    Panics if Algorithms is empty or if the required key material is missing for
    any listed algorithm.

func Logger(out io.Writer) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    Logger logs each request after it completes. Panics if out is nil.

    Opt L1: the original implementation used fmt.Fprintf(out, "%s %s %s %d %s\n"
    + 5 args) which boxes each argument as interface{} (5 allocs) and allocated
    a fresh *statusRecorder per request (1 alloc that escaped to heap). The new
    implementation pools the statusRecorder and assembles the log line into a
    pooled []byte buffer via direct strconv.Append*. Output bytes are identical:
    the format is "<RFC3339> <method> <path> <status> <duration>\n".

    WH-02: a single clock read at the end of the request (`end := time.Now()`)
    now serves both the logged timestamp (`end.AppendFormat`) and the logged
    duration (`end.Sub(start)`, monotonic exactly like time.Since) — the
    original implementation read the clock again for each. Sanitising method and
    path now appends straight into the pooled buffer (appendSanitisedForLog)
    instead of allocating a quoted string and copying it, and the duration is
    appended without allocating (appendLogDuration). The output format and every
    logged byte are unchanged; the request duration this logs now excludes
    the logger's own formatting work (it previously included the time spent
    reading and formatting the timestamp), which is closer to, not further from,
    the wrapped handler's true latency.

func NoCache() func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    NoCache sets response headers to prevent caching at every layer: browsers
    (Cache-Control / Pragma / Expires), CDNs (Surrogate-Control) and nginx-style
    reverse proxies (X-Accel-Expires). All headers are harmless to deployments
    that do not run an intermediate cache.

func OAuth2Introspect(opts OAuth2Options) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    OAuth2Introspect validates Bearer tokens via RFC 7662 token introspection.
    Active tokens are cached (keyed by sha256(token)) to avoid per-request
    network calls. On success, the IntrospectResponse is available via
    GetOAuth2Claims.

    When opts.HTTPClient is nil, call OAuth2Introspect during startup, before
    the process issues HTTP requests concurrently through http.DefaultTransport:
    the default client copies http.DefaultTransport's settings at this call (see
    OAuth2Options.HTTPClient).

    Panics if opts.Endpoint is empty, malformed, or non-HTTPS (unless
    opts.AllowInsecureEndpoint is true). Bearer tokens transmitted over
    plaintext are exposed to passive observers (RFC 7662 §4).

func RealIP(trustedCIDRs ...*netip.Prefix) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    RealIP overwrites r.RemoteAddr with the client IP derived from the
    X-Forwarded-For or X-Real-IP header. Only mutates RemoteAddr when the direct
    peer is within one of the trusted CIDR prefixes.

    XFF selection: the header is parsed as a comma-separated
    list and walked from RIGHTMOST toward leftmost, skipping entries that
    lie inside any trustedCIDRs. The first entry NOT inside a trusted CIDR
    is the real client IP. This rejects attacker-injected leftmost values:
    in a multi-hop chain (proxy1 + proxy2), if only proxy2 is trusted,
    the leftmost-XFF approach would pick a forged `client_ip` injected by the
    attacker, but the rightmost walk stops at proxy1 (the first untrusted hop)
    and falls back to its address. When the entire chain consists of trusted
    CIDRs, the leftmost entry is used as a last resort. With a single trusted
    proxy stripping inbound XFF (the documented baseline) the behaviour is
    identical to picking the leftmost.

    SECURITY: calling RealIP() with no CIDRs trusts every
    peer — any client can spoof the X-Forwarded-For / X-Real-IP header and the
    router will accept it as the real client IP. This is only safe behind a
    single trusted proxy that strips inbound XFF; in any other deployment it
    is a trivial spoofing primitive that defeats ThrottlePerIP and IP-based
    access controls. The middleware emits a slog.Warn at construction time when
    called without CIDRs so the misconfiguration is visible in startup logs.
    ALWAYS pass the proxy CIDR list explicitly in production.

    Proxy depth: each additional trusted proxy in the forwarding chain MUST
    be covered by a trustedCIDRs entry, otherwise the rightmost-walk stops too
    early and the proxy IP (rather than the real client) becomes RemoteAddr.

    IP values are validated via netip.ParseAddr, which rejects CRLF injection
    and malformed addresses, and IPv6 zone IDs are stripped via WithZone("").

func Recoverer() func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    Recoverer recovers from panics and writes a 500 response. Logs via
    slog.Default() — use RecovererWithLogger for a custom logger.

    Deprecated: use RecovererWithLogger(slog.Default()) for explicit control.

func RecovererWithLogger(logger *slog.Logger) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    RecovererWithLogger recovers from panics, logs the panic value and stack
    trace at Error level via logger, and writes a plain 500 response — but only
    if the wrapped handler has not already committed a response (sent a final
    status or written a body byte). A handler that panics after writing its
    own response is a handler bug independent of Recoverer: net/http itself
    discards a WriteHeader call once the status line is on the wire (logging
    "superfluous response.WriteHeader call" to its own ErrorLog), and Recoverer
    applies the same rule to the body: it never appends "Internal Server
    Error\n" after whatever the handler already streamed.

    The panic value is never written to the response body, preventing
    information leakage to clients.

func RequestID() func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    RequestID generates or propagates a request ID via X-Request-ID header.
    Incoming X-Request-ID values are validated; invalid or oversized values are
    replaced with a freshly generated random ID.

    Allocation budget: exactly 2 allocations per request, on either path
    (generated or propagated) — (1) the fused *requestIDCtx node, which also
    carries the hex-encoded id storage (buf) and the response header's []string
    backing array (hdr), and (2) r.WithContext's copy of *http.Request, required
    for a stdlib-compatible middleware so the id is reachable via r.Context()
    inside next.ServeHTTP. Down from 7 before rmp #245 (context.WithValue's
    *context.valueCtx node; boxing the id string into an `any`;
    hex.EncodeToString's separate string; canonicalising "X-Request-ID" on both
    the inbound Get and the outbound Set; and the []string{id} header-value
    slice). See reports/perf-lab-2026-09-24/results/fixes/245.txt for the
    measured gain.

func SetHeader(key, value string) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    SetHeader sets a fixed response header before calling the next handler.
    Panics at construction time if key or value contains CR or LF, as those
    bytes can reach downstream middleware in raw form even though Go's wire
    serialiser strips them before writing to the network.

    ORDERING: SetHeader runs Header().Set on the response at the
    START of its frame, BEFORE calling next. Middleware composition in MuxMaster
    wraps from outermost to innermost — the first Use() call is outermost. So if
    Use(CORS, SetHeader(...)) is registered, SetHeader runs LAST in the request
    flow (innermost) and its Set() will OVERWRITE any header CORS already wrote.
    Specifically, Use(CORS, SetHeader( "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"))
    silently bypasses the CORS allowed origins whitelist for every request.

    To preserve CORS guarantees, register SetHeader BEFORE CORS in the Use()
    chain (so SetHeader is the outermost frame and CORS overwrites it for the
    headers it manages), or omit any SetHeader call that targets a CORS-managed
    header (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, -Methods, -Headers, -Credentials,
    -Max-Age, -Expose-Headers, Vary).

func StripSlashes() func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    StripSlashes removes all trailing slashes from r.URL.Path before routing.
    Idempotent: "/a///" becomes "/a" (not "/a//").

    When r.URL.RawPath is set (the original raw form is preserved by
    net/http only when it differs from the decoded Path), StripSlashes
    also strips trailing '/' bytes from RawPath. Without this the dispatch
    path would diverge between Path and RawPath when Mux.UseRawPath is true.

    When the path has trailing slashes to strip, next receives a shallow
    copy of the request (see the Terminology section in the MuxMaster
    specification/README.md): a new *http.Request with a new URL, but sharing
    the original's header map and context. The original request passed to
    StripSlashes is never mutated.

func ThrottleAllBacklog(limit int, backlog int, timeout time.Duration) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    ThrottleAllBacklog limits concurrent handler execution globally, across
    all clients combined, with a backlog queue. It is an equivalent name for
    ThrottleBacklog: both return the same middleware with the same behaviour and
    panics. Use ThrottlePerIP for per-client limits.

func ThrottleBacklog(limit int, backlog int, timeout time.Duration) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    ThrottleBacklog limits concurrent handler execution globally, across all
    clients combined, with a backlog queue. At most limit requests run next
    at the same time; up to backlog further requests wait, each for at most
    timeout, for a free slot. A request that finds the backlog full, or whose
    wait times out, receives 503 Service Unavailable. Use ThrottlePerIP for
    per-client limits.

    ThrottleBacklog and ThrottleAllBacklog are equivalent names for the same
    middleware. Panics if limit <= 0 or backlog < 0.

func ThrottlePerIP(limit int, timeout time.Duration, keyFn func(*http.Request) string) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    ThrottlePerIP limits concurrent handler executions per client key.
    keyFn extracts the rate-limit key from the request; if nil, the host part
    of r.RemoteAddr is used. limit is the maximum concurrent requests per key;
    timeout is how long a request waits for a slot before receiving 503.

    SECURITY: when keyFn is nil, ThrottlePerIP keys on
    r.RemoteAddr — which is whatever the TCP peer's address is unless RealIP
    has previously rewritten it. Behind a load balancer that does not strip the
    LB's own address from RemoteAddr, every request appears to come from the LB
    and the per-IP limit degrades to a global rate limit. RealIP (with explicit
    trusted-proxy CIDRs) MUST be registered BEFORE ThrottlePerIP for per-client
    limits to be effective. See SECURITY.md "RealIP + ThrottlePerIP ordering".

    SECURITY: the internal per-key table is capped at
    DefaultThrottlePerIPMaxTableSize. When full, requests for NEW keys (those
    not already in the table) receive 503 immediately to bound memory under
    IP-churn attacks. Use ThrottlePerIPCapped to override the cap.

    Panics if limit <= 0.

func ThrottlePerIPCapped(limit int, timeout time.Duration, maxTableSize int, keyFn func(*http.Request) string) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    ThrottlePerIPCapped is ThrottlePerIP with an explicit cap on the number of
    distinct keys tracked. maxTableSize <= 0 disables the cap (legacy unbounded
    behaviour, NOT recommended in production).

    SATURATION BEHAVIOUR: when the table reaches
    maxTableSize and every slot has refs > 0 (i.e. all entries are in active
    use), new client IPs receive 503 immediately until at least one slot drains.
    An attacker controlling N >= maxTableSize distinct IPs can sustain this
    state for as long as their requests stay open. Mitigations:
      - deploy upstream DDoS scrubbing (Cloudflare, AWS Shield, etc.);
      - configure http.Server{ReadHeaderTimeout, IdleTimeout, ReadTimeout} so
        slow-handler connections cannot hold slots indefinitely;
      - lower maxTableSize for sensitive endpoints.

    Panics if limit <= 0.

func Timeout(d time.Duration) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    Timeout applies a context deadline to each request. Panics if d <= 0.

    SECURITY: Timeout cancels the request context after d, but
    it does NOT preempt the handler goroutine — Go has no preemption primitive
    for blocked syscalls. Handlers MUST observe ctx.Done() on every blocking
    call (DB, network, file I/O); a handler that ignores ctx.Done() will run to
    completion regardless of the timeout, accumulating goroutines under load and
    exhausting memory or upstream connections.

    Example of a timeout-aware handler:

        func myHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            ctx := r.Context()
            result := make(chan interface{}, 1)
            go func() { result <- doExpensiveWork() }()
            select {
            case val := <-result:
                w.Write([]byte(val.(string)))
            case <-ctx.Done():
                http.Error(w, "request timeout", http.StatusGatewayTimeout)
            }
        }

    Co-design Timeout with handler-level cooperation (use the *Context variants
    of the stdlib — sql.DB.QueryContext, net/http with http.Request, etc.).

func WithValue(key, val any) func(http.Handler) http.Handler
    WithValue injects a value into the request context. To avoid context key
    collisions between packages, always use an unexported type as the key:

        type ctxKey struct{}
        mux.Use(middleware.WithValue(ctxKey{}, myValue))

    SECURITY: passing a string (or any built-in type) as the key is a
    CWE-1021 cross-package collision risk — any package that uses the same
    string literal can read or overwrite this value. WithValue emits a slog.Warn
    at construction time when called with a string-kind key.

    JWTOptions configures the JWTAuth middleware.

    SECURITY: mixing algorithm families (HS* with RS* or ES*) in
    Algorithms reveals the algorithm path via response latency: the HS256
    and RS256 paths take measurably different time (see SECURITY.md "JWT
    Mixed-Family Algorithms"), and a client submitting tokens with different alg labels
    can determine which path the server runs from the response time alone —
    narrowing the search space for algorithm-confusion attacks (RFC 8725
    §3.1). Configure each endpoint with a single algorithm family. JWTAuth emits
    a slog.Warn at construction time when a mixed-family Algorithms list is
    detected.

## Common questions

<section data-conversation="api-overview">

### What does `muxmaster.New()` return?

`muxmaster.New()` returns a `*Mux` with production-safe defaults: `RedirectTrailingSlash`, `HandleMethodNotAllowed`, and `HandleOPTIONS` are `true`, and every other option is `false` or zero.

`*Mux` implements `http.Handler`, so it can be passed to `http.Server`, `httptest.NewServer`, or any other code that accepts a handler.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-routes">

### How do I register a route for a specific HTTP method?

Call the method helper on `*Mux` or `*Group`, for example `mux.GET(pattern, h)`, `mux.POST(pattern, h)`, or `mux.QUERY(pattern, h)`, each of which takes an `http.HandlerFunc`.

`Handle(method, pattern, handler)` takes any `http.Handler`, `Match` registers one handler for several methods, and `ANY` registers it for all ten supported methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE, and QUERY.

### How do I read a path parameter in a handler?

Call `muxmaster.PathParam(r, "id")` for a single value, or `muxmaster.ParamsFromContext(r.Context())` for all parameters as a `Params` slice.

`Params` offers `Get`, `Lookup`, `Map`, and typed accessors `Int`, `Int64`, `Uint64`, `Float64`, and `Bool`.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-query">

### Which symbols support the HTTP QUERY method?

MuxMaster supports the HTTP QUERY method (RFC 10008) with the constant `MethodQuery` (`"QUERY"`) and the methods `Mux.QUERY`, `Mux.QUERYE`, `Mux.QUERYFast`, `Group.QUERY`, and `Group.QUERYE`.

`Group` has no `QUERYFast`; register a fast QUERY route on a group with `g.HandleFast(muxmaster.MethodQuery, path, h)`. See [HTTP QUERY method (RFC 10008)](/docs/http-query-method).

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-middleware">

### What is the difference between `Pre`, `Use`, and `UseFast`?

`Pre` middleware wraps the whole dispatch and runs for every request, `Use` middleware wraps `Handle` routes registered after the call, and `UseFast` middleware wraps `HandleFast` routes registered after the call.

Registering a `HandleFast` route after `Use` panics, so a fast route can never silently skip `Use` middleware. Register policy that must cover both route types with `Pre`.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-groups">

### How do I create a route group with a shared prefix?

Call `mux.Group("/api/v1")`; the returned `*Group` has the same registration methods as `*Mux`, and every route registered on it gets the prefix.

`group.Use` adds middleware that wraps only the group's routes, `group.Group` creates a sub-group, and `mux.Route(prefix, fn)` creates a group and passes it to `fn`.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-errors">

### How do I return an error from a handler?

Register a `HandlerFuncE` (`func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) error`) with `HandleE` or a helper such as `GETE`, and set `Mux.ErrorHandler` to translate returned errors into responses.

Without an `ErrorHandler`, every returned error produces `500 Internal Server Error`. `muxmaster.Error(code, err)` returns an `HTTPError` whose `StatusCode()` an `ErrorHandler` can read with `errors.As`.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-response">

### How do I write a JSON response?

Call `muxmaster.JSON(w, code, v)`, which marshals `v`, sets `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`, writes the status code and the body, and returns any marshalling or write error.

The other response helpers are `XML`, `Text`, `Redirect`, and `NoContent`.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-fast">

### When should I use `HandleFast` instead of `Handle`?

Use `HandleFast` for hot routes whose handlers can take the path parameters as a third argument and do not need standard `func(http.Handler) http.Handler` middleware.

A `FastHandler` has the signature `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, Params)` and does not copy the request into a context bundle. It is wrapped only by `Pre` and `UseFast` middleware.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-introspection">

### How do I list the routes registered on a router?

Call `mux.Routes()`, which returns a `[]RouteInfo` with the method, pattern, and handler name of every `Handle` and `HandleFast` route.

`Walk` and `WalkFast` visit the routes with a callback, and `Lookup(method, path)` reports whether a method and path match a route without dispatching a request.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-config">

### How do I change router options after the server has started?

Assign the field and call `mux.Rebuild()`, because the first `ServeHTTP` call freezes the configuration into a snapshot that later assignments do not change.

`Rebuild` resets the snapshot and the cached 404, 405, OPTIONS, and redirect handlers, and is safe to call while the server is serving.

</section>

<section data-conversation="api-middleware-package">

### Which middleware constructors does the `middleware` package export?

The `middleware` package exports 21 constructors: `APIKey`, `BasicAuth`, `CORS`, `CleanPath`, `Compress`, `JWTAuth`, `Logger`, `NoCache`, `OAuth2Introspect`, `RealIP`, `Recoverer`, `RecovererWithLogger`, `RequestID`, `SetHeader`, `StripSlashes`, `ThrottleAllBacklog`, `ThrottleBacklog`, `ThrottlePerIP`, `ThrottlePerIPCapped`, `Timeout`, and `WithValue`.

`Recoverer` is deprecated in favour of `RecovererWithLogger`. Context accessors such as `GetRequestID`, `GetJWTClaims`, `GetOAuth2Claims`, and `GetAPIKeyIdentity` read the values that the middleware stores.
