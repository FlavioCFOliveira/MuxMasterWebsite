# Groups and Sub-Routers

Groups allow you to organize routes that share a common URL prefix and/or a common set of middleware. Sub-routers extend this further by allowing completely independent `*Mux` instances to be mounted at a path.

## Creating a Group

`Group` returns a `*Group` that shares the parent `*Mux` and prepends a path prefix to every route:

```go
mux := muxmaster.New()

api := mux.Group("/api/v1")
api.GET("/users", listUsers)      // → GET /api/v1/users
api.POST("/users", createUser)    // → POST /api/v1/users
api.GET("/users/:id", getUser)    // → GET /api/v1/users/:id
```

The group shares the same underlying tree as the parent router. Routes are registered directly into the parent mux with the full prefix prepended.

The prefix and the route path are joined with a single `/`: `mux.Group("/api/")` followed by `GET("/users", …)` registers `/api/users`, not `/api//users`. Nothing else is inserted or removed — `mux.Group("/api")` with `GET("users", …)` would produce `/apiusers`, so start route paths with `/`. The same join applies to sub-group prefixes, `Group.Mount` and `Group.ServeFiles`.

---

## Group Middleware

Middleware applied to a group wraps only the routes of that group. Mux-level `Use` middleware wraps the group middleware, so it runs first:

```go
mux := muxmaster.New()
mux.Use(middleware.Logger(os.Stdout)) // applied to every route

api := mux.Group("/api/v1")
api.Use(requireAPIKey)              // applied only to /api/v1/* routes

api.GET("/users", listUsers)
// request path: Logger → requireAPIKey → listUsers

mux.GET("/health", health)
// request path: Logger → health (no requireAPIKey)
```

**Important:** call `Use` before registering routes on the group, for the same reason it must be called before routes on the mux.

Group `Use` middleware does not wrap fast routes: `group.HandleFast` panics if the group has `Use` middleware. Use `group.UseFast` for `FastMiddleware`, or `mux.Pre` for policy that must cover every route.

---

## Nested Groups

Groups can be nested to any depth. Each level adds its prefix and optionally its own middleware:

```go
api := mux.Group("/api/v1")
api.Use(requireAPIKey)

// Sub-group for admin endpoints
admin := api.Group("/admin")
admin.Use(requireAdmin)

admin.GET("/stats", getStats)        // GET /api/v1/admin/stats
admin.DELETE("/users/:id", deleteUser) // DELETE /api/v1/admin/users/:id
```

A sub-group starts with a copy of its parent's middleware. Middleware added to either group afterwards does not affect the other.

---

## Inline Groups with `Route`

`Route` creates a sub-group and calls a closure with it. This is equivalent to calling `Group` manually, but keeps related routes visually grouped in the source code:

```go
mux.Route("/api/v1", func(api *muxmaster.Group) {
    api.Use(requireAPIKey)

    api.GET("/users", listUsers)
    api.POST("/users", createUser)

    api.Route("/admin", func(admin *muxmaster.Group) {
        admin.Use(requireAdmin)
        admin.DELETE("/users/:id", deleteUser)
        admin.GET("/stats", getStats)
    })
})
```

Groups can also call `Route` on themselves:

```go
api := mux.Group("/api/v1")
api.Route("/reports", func(g *muxmaster.Group) {
    g.GET("/daily", dailyReport)
    g.GET("/weekly", weeklyReport)
})
```

---

## Scoped Middleware with `With`

`With` returns a new group with additional middleware appended, without modifying the original group. It is useful for applying middleware to a single route:

```go
api := mux.Group("/api/v1")

// deleteUser is wrapped by both api's middleware and requireAdmin
api.With(requireAdmin).DELETE("/users/:id", deleteUser)

// processPayment is wrapped by both api's middleware and rateLimit + auditLog
api.With(rateLimit, auditLog).POST("/payments", processPayment)

// listUsers uses only api's middleware
api.GET("/users", listUsers)
```

---

## Mounting Sub-Routers

`Mount` attaches a separate `http.Handler` at a path prefix. The prefix is stripped from the request URL before it is forwarded to the mounted handler. This allows independently built routers to be composed:

```go
// Version 2 router — built and tested independently
v2 := muxmaster.New()
v2.GET("/users", listUsersV2)
v2.POST("/users", createUserV2)

// Attach to the main router
mux.Mount("/v2", v2)
// GET /v2/users → v2 sees GET /users
```

The mounted handler receives `r.URL.Path` with the prefix stripped, so a sub-router mounted at `/v2` sees `/users`, not `/v2/users`. A request for `/v2/` reaches it as `/`, and a request for the bare prefix `/v2` is redirected to `/v2/` when `RedirectTrailingSlash` is `true`.

**How a mount is registered:** trailing slashes are removed from the prefix, and the mount is registered under the internal method `"*"` with the pattern `<prefix>/*mux_mount`; `Routes()` lists it that way. The mount receives requests of **every** method, including methods the router does not support for normal routes. A route registered for the request's method takes precedence over the mount: with `GET /v2/health` registered on `mux`, a GET for that path never reaches `v2`, while a POST for it does. The prefix may contain parameters, but its last element must not be an optional parameter (that panics).

**Middleware:** `Use` middleware registered on `mux` before the `Mount` call wraps the mounted handler and sees the original, unstripped request, as does `Pre` middleware.

**Request handling:**

Before forwarding to the mounted handler, MuxMaster creates a shallow request copy — a new `*http.Request` that shares the header map and context with the original, but carries a new `*url.URL` with the stripped `Path` (and `RawPath`, when it can be stripped consistently). The original request passed to `ServeHTTP` is never modified. The forwarded request does not carry the original path; if the mounted handler needs it, read it in middleware registered before `Mount`.

**Redirects from a mounted `*Mux`:** when the mounted handler is itself a `*muxmaster.Mux`, its own trailing-slash and fixed-path redirects keep the mount prefix — `v2`'s redirect from `/users/` to `/users` reaches the client as `Location: /v2/users`. Redirects that your own code issues (for example with `http.Redirect`) are not rewritten.

### Organizing a large application

```go
func main() {
    mux := muxmaster.New()
    mux.Use(middleware.Logger(os.Stdout))
    mux.Use(middleware.RecovererWithLogger(slog.Default()))

    mux.Mount("/api/v1", newV1Router())
    mux.Mount("/api/v2", newV2Router())
    mux.Mount("/admin",  newAdminRouter())

    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux))
}

func newV1Router() http.Handler {
    mux := muxmaster.New()
    mux.Use(requireAPIKey)
    mux.GET("/users", listUsers)
    mux.POST("/users", createUser)
    return mux
}
```

---

## Mounting on a Group

`Mount` is also available on `*Group`, which combines the group's prefix with the mount prefix. The group's `Use` middleware wraps the mounted handler, so a group protected by an authentication middleware also protects what is mounted on it:

```go
api := mux.Group("/api")
v1 := muxmaster.New()
v1.GET("/users", listUsers)

api.Mount("/v1", v1)
// GET /api/v1/users → handled by listUsers
```

---

## Serving Static Files from a Group

`ServeFiles` on a group prepends the group prefix:

```go
assets := mux.Group("/static")
assets.ServeFiles("/*filepath", http.Dir("./public"))
// GET /static/css/main.css → ./public/css/main.css
```

`ServeFiles` registers GET and HEAD routes and serves them with `http.FileServer`, which cleans the path, so `..` segments cannot escape the root. The prefix must end with `/*name`; `ServeFiles` panics otherwise, or if the root is `nil`.

---

## Design Patterns

### API versioning

```go
v1 := mux.Group("/api/v1")
v2 := mux.Group("/api/v2")

v1.GET("/users", listUsersV1)
v2.GET("/users", listUsersV2)
```

### Feature-based organization

Group by feature domain rather than by HTTP method:

```go
mux.Route("/api/v1", func(api *muxmaster.Group) {
    api.Use(requireAPIKey)

    // Users domain
    api.Route("/users", func(g *muxmaster.Group) {
        g.GET("", listUsers)
        g.POST("", createUser)
        g.GET("/:id", getUser)
        g.PUT("/:id", updateUser)
        g.DELETE("/:id", deleteUser)
    })

    // Orders domain
    api.Route("/orders", func(g *muxmaster.Group) {
        g.GET("", listOrders)
        g.POST("", createOrder)
        g.GET("/:id", getOrder)
    })
})
```

### Micro-service composition

Mount independent services behind a reverse proxy router:

```go
mux := muxmaster.New()
trustedProxy := netip.MustParsePrefix("10.0.0.0/8")
mux.Use(middleware.RealIP(&trustedProxy))
mux.Use(middleware.RequestID())

mux.Mount("/auth",    authService)
mux.Mount("/catalog", catalogService)
mux.Mount("/orders",  orderService)
mux.Mount("/payment", paymentService)
```

## Common questions

<section data-conversation="groups-patterns">

### How do I group routes that share a path prefix?

Call `mux.Group("/api/v1")` and register routes on the returned `*Group`; each route gets the prefix, so `api.GET("/users", h)` registers `GET /api/v1/users`.

The prefix and the route path are joined with a single `/`, so `mux.Group("/api/")` followed by `GET("/users", h)` also registers `/api/users`.

### How do I apply middleware to only the routes of a group?

Call `group.Use(mw)` before registering the group's routes; the middleware wraps only those routes.

Mux-level `Use` middleware still wraps group routes and runs first. `group.With(mw)` returns a copy of the group with extra middleware, which is useful for a single route.

### How do I attach an independent router under a prefix?

Call `mux.Mount("/v2", sub)`, which forwards every request under `/v2` to `sub` with the prefix stripped from `r.URL.Path`.

The mounted handler can be any `http.Handler`, including another `*muxmaster.Mux`. A route registered on the outer router for the request's method takes precedence over the mount, and a request for the bare prefix `/v2` is redirected to `/v2/` when `RedirectTrailingSlash` is `true`.
